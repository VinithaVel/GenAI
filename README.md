The problem at hand involves predicting weather conditions based on historical data. Given a dataset containing information such as precipitation, maximum and minimum temperature, wind speed, and date, the goal is to develop a predictive model that can accurately classify the weather condition (e.g., rain, sun, fog) for a given set of features.

The challenges in this problem include dealing with the variability and complexity of weather patterns, capturing dependencies between different weather features, and handling any noise or inconsistencies in the dataset. Additionally, ensuring the model's accuracy and reliability for real-world applications is crucial, as accurate weather predictions are vital for various sectors such as agriculture, transportation, and urban planning.
